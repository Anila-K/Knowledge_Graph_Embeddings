# Knowledge Graph Builder with OpenAI Embeddings

This project demonstrates how to build a simple **knowledge graph** using **OpenAIâ€™s `text-embedding-ada-002`** model and **Neo4j** to:

- Generate semantic embeddings for input sentences
- Store them as graph nodes
- Create similarity-based relationships between them
- Perform semantic similarity queries

---

## Features

- Accepts a list of text inputs
- Generates embeddings using OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002`
- Stores sentences and embeddings in **Neo4j**
- Connects similar sentences using cosine similarity
- Queries for the most semantically similar node to new input
